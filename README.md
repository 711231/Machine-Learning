## Machine-Learning 
### Final Project

#### 1. Introduction
In the world of professional basketball, player statistics serve as a critical resource for evaluating performance, developing strategies, and making informed decisions. This project focuses on analyzing the statistical data of NBA players. With the evolution of the game, understanding how players performed during this era can provide valuable insights into the foundation of modern basketball.

#### 2. Data Structure
The dataset includes the following fields, with their meanings as follows:
- **Year**: The season year (e.g., 1950).
- **Player**: Player's name (e.g., "Curly Armstrong").
- **Pos**: Player's position (positions such as G-F, SG, SF, F-C, C represent different roles on the court, like guard, forward, and center).
- **Age**: Player's age.
- **Tm**: Abbreviation of the player's team (e.g., "FTW" stands for Fort Wayne Pistons).
- **G**: The number of games played by the player during the season.
- **GS**: The number of games the player started.
- **MP**: The total minutes played by the player during the season.
- **FG**: Number of field goals made by the player.
- **FGA**: Number of field goals attempted by the player.
- **FG%**: Field goal percentage (made/attempted).
- **3P**: Number of three-point field goals made.
- **3PA**: Number of three-point attempts.
- **3P%**: Three-point percentage (made/attempted).
- **2P**: Number of two-point field goals made.
- **2PA**: Number of two-point attempts.
- **2P%**: Two-point percentage (made/attempted).
- **eFG%**: Effective field goal percentage (considering the impact of three-point shots).
- **FT**: Number of free throws made.
- **FTA**: Number of free throw attempts.
- **FT%**: Free throw percentage (made/attempted).
- **ORB**: Offensive rebounds.
- **DRB**: Defensive rebounds.
- **TRB**: Total rebounds (offensive + defensive).
- **AST**: Assists.
- **STL**: Steals.
- **BLK**: Blocks.
- **TOV**: Turnovers.
- **PF**: Personal fouls.
- **PTS**: Total points scored by the player during the season.

#### 3. Project overview
1. **Data Exploration**: To thoroughly explore the dataset, identifying key patterns and trends in player statistics, such as scoring, rebounding, and assisting. This exploration will include visualizations that highlight the distribution of various metrics, such as points per game, shooting percentages, and player efficiency.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: To conduct a detailed statistical analysis of the data, including measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance). Additionally, we will examine correlations between different statistics to understand how they relate to one another, helping to identify potential factors that influence player performance.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**: To formulate and test hypotheses regarding player performance and team dynamics. This includes analyzing differences in performance metrics across various teams and positions, as well as exploring the potential existence of the Simpson's Paradox within the data.

4. **Machine Learning Modeling**: To apply machine learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and linear regression, to classify players and predict performance outcomes based on historical statistics. This will allow us to assess the effectiveness of different models in making accurate predictions about player success.
